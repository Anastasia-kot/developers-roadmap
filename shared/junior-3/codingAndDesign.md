# Basic principles of coding and design

## The Goal
Consolidate most important and common coding principles for all programming languages. Get acquainted with basic notions of design. All design questions do not require detailed answers. This topic implies preparation for [basic design principles](https://github.com/fullstack-development/developers-roadmap/blob/master/shared/middle-1/design.md).


## Coding
* What are magic numbers and why they are bad?
* Why it is important to test code? What are black-box testing and white-box testing?
* What is the difference between the following types of testing: unit testing, component testing, integration testing, regression testing, system testing?
* Is it important to write code with maximum optimization? When you have to start thinking about forcing optimization? Why?

## Design
* Why it is important to think over requirements in advance? Is it possible to overdo it?
* Explain the following practices of design: Iterate, Divide and Conquer, Top-Down and Bottom-Up design approaches.
* What is Complexity? What is the difference between Accidental Complexity and Essential Complexity?
* What is Cohesion?
* What is Coupling?
