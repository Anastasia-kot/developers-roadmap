# Testing

* What is the Testing pyramid? What role do tests play in it? What about a static analyzer?
* Can types be considered as a complete replacement of unit-tests? Why?
* What is end-to-end tests? How do they differ from integration ones?
* When do tests actually slow down development and when do they speed it up?
* Can tests be considered as a full part of a system and code base?
* Why is testing less convenient if both private and public methods are tested? 
* What is a Test Double and a Fake? How do they differ from a Mock and a Stub?
* What's the difference between behavior verification testing and state verification testing?
* Why does Mocks usage lead to behavior verification?
* What is solitary testing and sociable testing? What are the advantages of solitary tests? Is there any advantage in sociable testing approach?
* Why does Mocks usage make "outside-in" design approach easier?
* Why should the aim be to run tests as convenient as possible and with a single command?
* Is it worth creating "training" integration tests that can only be run manually and for testing of a public API (e.g. Web API Github) only?
