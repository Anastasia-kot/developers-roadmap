# Isomorphic rendering

* What is server/client/isomorphic rendering?
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of each of rendering types?
* Describe the general architecture of server/client/isomorphic rendering:
  * What are the components of each architecture?
  * What does a client server usually perform provided that the architecture is isomorphic?
  * How is routing handled in each case?
  * Which areas of responsibility do a front-server, API-server and client himself cover? What computations does each of those parts handle?
* How to turn a usual application into a isomorphic one? (describe isomorphic nature in detail, check out some implementations) 
* How can we implement an isomorphic SPA without setting up any SSR-server?
* How to implement data pre-fetching in an isomorphic application?
* What would your advice for a customer be on when to use a client server and an isomorphic one?
