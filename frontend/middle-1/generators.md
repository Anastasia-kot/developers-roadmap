* What are iterators? What is the difference between iterators and regular loops?
* To tell about the iteration protocols:
  * Symbol.iterator
  * Symbol.asyncIterator
* What are iterators for if there are arrays already?
* What is the difference between iterator an array and iterator through constructions: ```for```, ```for of```, ```for in```?
* What are generators? Where can they be useful?
* What do you think why `yield` exactly is used as a keyword? 
* How to work with async generators?
